## Cancer Stem Cells and Tumor Population Dynamics

This project explores the role of **Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs)** in driving tumor growth and heterogeneity. By combining **biological insights** with **mathematical population dynamics models**, the study investigates how CSCs contribute to cancer progression, their experimental identification, and challenges associated with targeting them.

1. **Introduction to Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs)**

   * CSCs are a small subpopulation within tumors.
   * They exhibit **self-renewal** and **differentiation**, fueling cancer growth.
   * First identified by John Dick in AML during the late 1990s.

2. **Experimental Identification of CSCs**

   * Typically involves **cell sorting (FACS)** using surface markers (e.g., CD44+/CD24âˆ’).
   * Tumor formation is validated via transplantation into immunocompromised mice.
   * Challenges: lack of universal markers, reversible marker expression, and loss of tumor microenvironment context.

3. **Population Dynamics Modeling**

   * **Branching process models** describe CSC division: symmetric renewal, asymmetric division, or differentiation.
   * Key parameter: **Ïµ = pâ‚‚ âˆ’ pâ‚€** (net CSC increase per generation).
   * Dynamics equations predict tumor growth is largely driven by CSC expansion.
   * Phenotypic switching models highlight the resilience of CSC populations under depletion, often showing overshoot behavior mediated by **miRNA networks**.

4. **Biological Predictions**

   * Normal tissue (Ïµ = 0): higher senescence, fewer CSCs.
   * Tumors (Ïµ > 0): reduced senescence, more CSCs.
   * Aggressive tumors show higher CSC fractions.
   * Predictions validated with melanoma growth studies (e.g., ABCG2+ vs. ABCG2âˆ’ cells).
